*Good morning, I'm* **XDeadHackerX** *and I want to introduce you my new tool called* **The_Spy's_Job**. *This Tool is focused on* **OSINT** *of almost all the fields* **(People, Nicknames, Social Networks, Emails, Phone Numbers, Websites, Public IPs and Images)** 

*My idea was to compile and automate all the most Advanced OSINT techniques possible in a single Tool and thus work in the most comfortable and fastest way possible, since we only have to give a couple of clicks and it will only start to collect and display in an orderly and classified way all the Information. All the sections are separated by parts in case you only want to extract a type of information in concrete, but also it counts on the penultimate option that combines all the Options so that it extracts all that is capable of the data that we have introduced to him. 

I will be updating the repository, adding new things and fixing bugs. All the Techniques of subtraction of data and information that appear in the Tool I have been studying and storing them during the last 5 years.

*I ask you please that if you liked this great Project support it by giving it a * **Star** ‚òÖ, *at the end of the repository there is also the option to invite me to a coffee, but sincerely you support me more by giving it a * **Star** ‚òÖ, *this way I will see my effort in this Project valued.

## üõ† Install üõ† Tool.

0) Install and use the Tool with **Root**.

```
1) pkg update && upgrade -y

2) pkg install git

3) pkg install python

4) pkg install python2

5) pkg install neofetch

6) git clone https://github.com/Unlimited-Crack-You/Fromv1-2009-UCH

7) cd Fromv1-2009-UCH

8) bash update.sh
```

7) Check Option 0 and then 1 to install the dependencies (Only check the first time)

8) Inside Option 0 we find sections 2 and 3 which we can configure the free APIs to get the free 
these free APIs to get the most out of The_spy_job

9) Now we can enjoy the tool

## üé≤ Take into account üé≤

**1]** In the Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements) when we click on Option 1 to Install the Requirements it will ask us to set a user that **does not** have root permissions, this step is very important, because if we set a user with root permissions, or we write it wrong or we double it, the Options that have to open a Browser from the Terminal will not work.

**2]** In the Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements) we can Configure the API of veriphone.io, shodan.io and zoomeye.org to get the best out of this Tool, both are free.

3]**[3]** In the Section ([7] Public IP Information) with the use of VPN most servers give wrong answers about their ports. To solve this I have put several Scanners and 2 of them give you the correct ports in spite of the VPN.

4]**[4]** Use the tool with Firefox closed, this is because the tool opens multiple tabs and if Firefox is already running you will still get an error.

**[5]** I personally recommend using the Tool with the Terminal in Full Screen (Graphically nicer).
