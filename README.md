these free APIs to get the most out of The_spy_job

9) Now we can enjoy the tool

## 🎲 Take into account 🎲

**1]** In the Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements) when we click on Option 1 to Install the Requirements it will ask us to set a user that **does not** have root permissions, this step is very important, because if we set a user with root permissions, or we write it wrong or we double it, the Options that have to open a Browser from the Terminal will not work.

**2]** In the Section ([0] Install and Configure Requirements) we can Configure the API of veriphone.io, shodan.io and zoomeye.org to get the best out of this Tool, both are free.

3]**[3]** In the Section ([7] Public IP Information) with the use of VPN most servers give wrong answers about their ports. To solve this I have put several Scanners and 2 of them give you the correct ports in spite of the VPN.

4]**[4]** Use the tool with Firefox closed, this is because the tool opens multiple tabs and if Firefox is already running you will still get an error.

**[5]** I personally recommend using the Tool with the Terminal in Full Screen (Graphically nicer).
